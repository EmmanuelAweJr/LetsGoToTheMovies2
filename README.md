Let's Go To The Movies Project
In this project we will be evaluating two movies from the Action and Adventure genre. Keep Reading to reveal the name of both movies of these exciting movies!

Fellows from the Data Science East- Innovation Fellowship Class 2023-2024
Lead Instructor: Farukh S. Assistant Instructor: Mo C.
Fellows Group Participants:
Jacob L., Naseha C., Emmanuel A., Marco A., and Donna H.

#Reason for this Research: This is a requirement for Phase I of the Data Science Fellowship completion. Due: 12-15-2023
In addition, to have a little fun! Often times we as Data Scientists spend a tremendous amount of time researching topics that may not necessarily be interesting to our familes or friends. With this project the goal is to mix research with fun. And possibly uncover some interesting facts about film making, movie goer's, human nature and how world events play a part in even the selection of the movie. Let's Do It!

#Hypotheseis: ( This will be a combination of everyone's opinions intertragted into 1 official statement. )

#Research Goals
Goal 1
Goal 2

And for the Grand Finale...The name of the two Action and Adventure movies are:___________________________ and ________________________________

#1. DATA

There are several theatrical data sources that are available. This data represents a composite of multiple sources, from actors, stage crews, directors, movie goers and more. We have decided to use the following for this project: 
The Numbers
https://www.the-numbers.com/
IMDB
https://www.imdb.com/

#2. METHOD

The primary objectise is the begin with clean data. Then place that data in a predictive model.

1. Linear Regression Model
2. Model 2
3. Model 3

#3. CLEANING

(Add Cleaning Report? or Data Vizualization Graph)
The purpose of this is to present the data in the most unencumbered manner psossible. The data has been cleared of duplicate rows, and columns, NAN, Non-NaN, and Blanks.

#4. EDA

( Depict / Include the EDA Report)

HERE... Provide written analysis
ALSO... Provide Data Vizualizations total number unknown at this time.

#5. MODELING

( Provide Pre-Processing Report Modeling Report)

Provide the Linearn Regression Model Data visualization and written analysis

ML also?

#7. FURTHER RESEARCH
